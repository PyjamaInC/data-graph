Absolutely! The outputs are quite short because of conservative token limits. Here's exactly how to increase them for much richer, more detailed content:

## üéØ **Current Token Limits (Why Outputs Are Short)**

### **Global Default**: Only 300 tokens!
```python
# src/knowledge_graph/llm_config.py
DEFAULT_CONFIGS = {
    "ollama": LLMProviderConfig(
        max_tokens=300,  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Very conservative!
    )
}
```

### **Per-Function Limits**: Mixed ranges
```python
# Various modules use different limits:
title_generation: 50 tokens      # Very short titles
usage_guides: 300 tokens        # Brief descriptions  
business_summaries: 500 tokens  # Medium detail
documentation: 600 tokens       # More comprehensive
query_responses: 800 tokens     # Most detailed
```

## üöÄ **How to Increase Output Length**

### **Method 1: Update Global Configuration** (Recommended)

### **Method 2: Increase Per-Function Limits for Ultra-Detailed Content**




## üìà **What You Can Expect With Increased Token Limits**

### **Before vs After Token Comparison**
| Component | Before | After | Expected Output Length |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------------------|
| **Global Config** | 300 tokens | **1500 tokens** | 5x longer content |
| **Business Summaries** | 500 tokens | **1200 tokens** | 2.4x more detailed |
| **ML Assessments** | 400 tokens | **1000 tokens** | 2.5x more comprehensive |
| **Usage Guides** | 300 tokens | **1200 tokens** | 4x more practical guidance |
| **Query Responses** | 800 tokens | **1500 tokens** | 1.9x more detailed answers |
| **Relationship Insights** | 300 tokens | **1000 tokens** | 3.3x deeper analysis |

### **Method 3: Environment Variables** (For Dynamic Control)

You can also control token limits dynamically without code changes:

```bash
# Set environment variables for even higher limits
export LLM_OLLAMA_MAX_TOKENS=2000
export LLM_OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=120

# Then run your test
python test_real_data.py
```

## üéØ **Expected Output Improvements**

### **Business Summaries - Before vs After**

**Before (500 tokens):**
```
"This table represents order transaction data for e-commerce platform 
with 50,000 records tracking purchase through delivery..."
```

**After (1200 tokens):**
```
**Business Purpose & Strategic Value**
This orders table serves as the operational backbone of our e-commerce 
ecosystem, capturing the complete customer journey from initial purchase 
intent through final delivery confirmation. With 50,000 comprehensive 
transaction records, it represents our core revenue-generating activities.

**Data Quality Assessment & Business Impact**
The excellent 91.6% quality score reflects robust data collection processes, 
though targeted improvements in order approval timestamp capture could 
enhance operational visibility. Missing approval data affects 12% of records, 
potentially limiting real-time process monitoring capabilities.

**Key Business Insights & Patterns**
Analysis reveals strong temporal correlations between purchase and delivery 
events (87% correlation), indicating predictable fulfillment patterns. 
However, delivery date distribution shows concerning skewness, suggesting 
potential process bottlenecks requiring investigation.

**Revenue & Operational Implications**
This dataset enables comprehensive revenue tracking, customer lifecycle 
analysis, and operational efficiency monitoring. The temporal completeness 
supports trend analysis, seasonality detection, and demand forecasting 
crucial for inventory and capacity planning.

**Risk Assessment & Mitigation**
Primary risks include approval timestamp gaps impacting real-time tracking 
and delivery anomalies suggesting process inconsistencies. Recommended 
immediate actions include implementing automated approval logging and 
investigating extreme delivery timeframes.

**Strategic Recommendations**
1. Implement real-time dashboard for order pipeline monitoring
2. Establish automated quality alerts for approval timestamp compliance
3. Investigate delivery process optimization opportunities
4. Leverage temporal patterns for demand forecasting models
```

### **ML Assessments - Before vs After**

**Before (400 tokens):**
```
"ML readiness score: 75/100. Dataset shows potential for machine 
learning applications with good data quality and feature diversity..."
```

**After (1000 tokens):**
```
**Overall ML Suitability Assessment**
This dataset achieves a strong 75% ML readiness score, positioning it 
as highly suitable for predictive modeling initiatives. The combination 
of 50,000 records, excellent data quality (92%), and rich temporal 
features creates optimal conditions for advanced analytics.

**Recommended ML Use Cases & Applications**
1. **Delivery Time Prediction**: Regression models using order characteristics 
   to predict delivery timeframes, enabling proactive customer communication
2. **Order Status Classification**: Multi-class models to predict order 
   progression and identify potential fulfillment bottlenecks
3. **Customer Lifetime Value Modeling**: Time-series analysis incorporating 
   order patterns for revenue forecasting
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Unsupervised learning to identify unusual order 
   patterns indicating fraud or system issues

**Feature Engineering Opportunities**
- Temporal features: Order-to-delivery duration, day-of-week patterns, 
  seasonal indicators
- Derived metrics: Order velocity, customer frequency segmentation, 
  geographic clustering
- Interaction features: Customer-product combinations, temporal-geographic 
  correlations

**Data Preprocessing Requirements**
- Address 8% missing approval timestamps through imputation or exclusion
- Normalize delivery time outliers (2.3% of records exceed normal ranges)
- Create categorical encodings for order status progression
- Implement time-series feature extraction for temporal modeling

**Expected Model Performance & Validation**
Based on data characteristics, expect 85-92% accuracy for classification 
tasks and R¬≤ values of 0.75-0.85 for regression models. Temporal validation 
using time-based splits essential for production deployment.

**Implementation Timeline & Resource Requirements**
- Proof of concept: 2-3 weeks with 1 data scientist
- Production deployment: 6-8 weeks with dedicated ML engineering support
- Infrastructure needs: Real-time scoring pipeline, model monitoring dashboard
- Expected business value: 15-25% improvement in delivery prediction accuracy
```
