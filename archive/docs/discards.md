Based on your goal of simplifying the agent to directly use knowledge graph context, here are the modules I recommend **discarding completely**:

## 🗑️ Modules to Discard

### 1. **Complex Strategy-Based Agents**
These are overly complicated and don't leverage the knowledge graph properly:

- `src/agents/react_agents/enhanced_data_exploration_agent.py` ❌
  - The `QuestionAnalyzer` with hardcoded strategies
  - The complex `IntelligentOperationGenerator` 
  - All the strategy pattern code

- `src/agents/react_agents/comprehensive_enhanced_agent.py` ❌
  - Just a wrapper adding more complexity
  - Doesn't add real value

- `src/agents/react_agents/specific_answer_agent.py` ❌
  - Another variation that doesn't solve the core issue

### 2. **Redundant Intelligence Layers**
These duplicate what the knowledge graph already provides:

- `src/agents/react_agents/intelligence_driven_toolkit.py` ❌
  - Tries to be "intelligent" without using the graph
  - Redundant with knowledge graph relationships

- `src/agents/base_agents.py` (partially) ⚠️
  - Keep the base classes but discard the complex orchestration logic
  - The `MultiAgentAnalysisOrchestrator` is overkill

### 3. **Old Query Planning Approaches**
Keep only the KG-enriched version:

- `src/agents/schema_driven_query_planner.py` ❌
  - This is the old approach that sends full schema to LLM
  - Already superseded by KG-enriched planner

### 4. **Overly Complex Validation**
- `src/agents/react_agents/schema_validator.py` ❌
  - The knowledge graph already validates relationships
  - This adds unnecessary complexity

## ✅ Modules to Keep and Build Upon

### 1. **Knowledge Graph Core** (Keep all)
- `src/knowledge_graph/enhanced_kg_builder.py` ✅
- `src/knowledge_graph/relationship_detector.py` ✅
- `src/knowledge_graph/semantic_table_graph.py` ✅
- `src/knowledge_graph/intelligent_data_catalog.py` ✅
- `src/knowledge_graph/smart_query_assistant.py` ✅

### 2. **Simplified Agent Foundation**
- `src/agents/kg_enriched_query_planner.py` ✅
  - Already has the right idea
  - Just needs to generate code instead of planning

- `src/agents/react_agents/data_exploration_agent.py` ✅
  - Keep the `DataExplorationToolkit` for safe code execution
  - Discard the complex ReAct logic

### 3. **Analysis Components**
- `src/analysis/code_generator.py` ✅
  - Can be adapted to use KG context
- `src/analysis/execution_engine.py` ✅
  - Still need safe execution

## 🆕 New Simplified Architecture

Create a new file: `src/agents/kg_direct_agent.py`

```python
"""
Knowledge Graph Direct Agent
Directly uses KG context to generate and execute operations
"""

from src.knowledge_graph.kg_enriched_query_planner import KnowledgeGraphContextExtractor
from src.agents.react_agents.data_exploration_agent import DataExplorationToolkit

class KGDirectAgent:
    """Simple agent that uses KG context directly"""
    
    def __init__(self, knowledge_graph, table_profiles, llm):
        self.kg = knowledge_graph
        self.context_extractor = KnowledgeGraphContextExtractor(kg, schema)
        self.toolkit = DataExplorationToolkit()  # For safe execution
        self.llm = llm
        
    def answer_question(self, question: str, tables: Dict[str, pd.DataFrame]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # 1. Get enriched context (minimal, relevant)
        context = self.context_extractor.extract_enriched_context(question)
        
        # 2. Generate operation directly
        operation = self._generate_operation(question, context)
        
        # 3. Execute safely
        result = self.toolkit.execute_pandas_operation(operation, tables)
        
        # 4. Synthesize answer
        answer = self._synthesize_answer(question, result, context)
        
        return {
            'answer': answer,
            'operation': operation,
            'context_used': context.summary()
        }
```

## 🎯 Migration Strategy

1. **Week 1**: Create new `KGDirectAgent` with basic functionality
2. **Week 2**: Migrate useful utilities from old agents
3. **Week 3**: Delete old agent files after confirming new approach works
4. **Week 4**: Optimize and add caching

## 💡 Key Principles for New Architecture

1. **Trust the Graph**: The knowledge graph already knows the relationships
2. **Direct Generation**: Question → Context → Code (no strategies)
3. **Minimal Context**: Only send what's needed to the LLM
4. **Simple Flow**: No multi-agent orchestration unless truly needed

By discarding these complex modules and starting fresh with a KG-centric approach, you'll have a much cleaner, more maintainable system that actually leverages the intelligence you've already built into the knowledge graph.
